Hello there everyone,

I can't get any feedback from my own devblog on this website so I decided to open a devlog topic on TIGSource forums. You can find most recent updates at
<h1><strong><a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=50838" target="_blank">my forum post</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/naezith" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</strong></h1>
Have a nice day!
