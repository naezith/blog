title: "Insane changelog.txt of Remnants of Naezith"
date: 2024-07-28
---

It's been 6.5 years since [Remnants of Naezith](https://store.steampowered.com/app/590590/Remnants_of_Naezith/)'s release and sometimes I can't believe I actually completed that "giant" project. And one of the craziest part about it is the consistent `changelog.txt` file that I filled for years. I started making the game on August 2014 but I made that log file a bit later. I invented the format myself. I know it could be better to use ISO dates but I didn't do that. 

This is not autogenerated from Git history, it's completely manually written.

Here is that beautiful beast:
