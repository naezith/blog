<strong>Update:</strong>
I can't get any feedback from my own devblog on this website so I decided to open a devlog topic on <strong>TIGSource</strong> forums. You can find most recent updates at

<strong>Remnants of <span style="color: #008080;">Naezith</span></strong> is a fast-paced platformer which has the grappling hook in it's core! It focuses on having freedom of movements, solid character control and not having any speed limitations. The fun of swinging with grappling hooks and the amazing feel of acceleration makes a great combination in this game.

You play as a "human body" which is under control of two souls, the human himself and soul of the dead ancient thunder dragon, <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Naezith</strong></span>!

<strong>STORY</strong>
<em><span style="color: #008080;">Naezith</span> the Thunder Dragon was so mighty and magical but even he, just like any other living, had merged in soil ages ago... but his soul still lingered on the Earth.</em>

<span style="color: #008080;">Naezith</span>, with his soul, started searching for a convenient body to eradicate the remnants of his omnipotent flesh, doing so to prevent people to overtake his supreme powers and play gods by dint of the power that coming from his almightiness he would never consider to share...

The Terran already found the remnants, however, they were never brave enough to interact with them, even a glimpse caused a blue funk because the radiation it emitted was insanely scary. Instead of destroying those remnants, they decided to build a high-level protection around them to ensure no one would ever reach them until they found out a safe way of acting.

Meanwhile... it was an ordinary day for an underground treasure hunter travelling the caves and trying to find precious loot to plunder. He had his rope and rusty hook with him which he needed them for crossing across the big pits if he had encountered one within the caves. Everything was going as usual until his hook slipped from the ledge and he fell down a pit. When he woke up, he saw two claws bound to his hands, <span style="color: #008080;">Naezith</span> finally found a proper body to use in his purpose and he started possessing the body. Treasure hunter was trying to get off of the claws but it was all in vain, he could not. He went mad and started swinging his arms unconsciously, again it was all naught. All of a sudden, one of the claws was shot off and sticked into the wall. A beam appeared between his hand and the claw, he pulled his arm back and noticed he could pull the claw out of the wall. It worked just like his rusty hook.

<span style="color: #008080;">Naezith</span> would not fully possess his body, instead, he made a deal with the man that the man would help him get rid of the remnants of <span style="color: #008080;">Naezith</span>, using his mighty powers. And he would get a gift at the and of the journey; an unlimited treasure he always lusted for.

I could not have the .webm embed but <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/HfhWR79" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> is <strong>a blazing fast speedrun clip</strong>.

<strong>First rough concept drawings of the main character</strong></p>
<strong>About me and the project:</strong>
My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/tolgaay_" target="_blank"><strong>Tolga</strong></a>, Iâ€™m a 20 y/o student at Yildiz Technical University, department of Computer Engineering. I am at third year, fifth semester. I started coding this project in 04.08.2014 so it's been a while. Whole reason was to learn C++ and sharpen my skills on it so I thought a game project would help me with that. I am a FPS player myself, I really love fast-paced and skill-based games and a platformer game would be easy for me to start with, even if I'm not good at playing that genre. I picked <strong>C++ with SFML</strong> and it was fun that I never thought about using some engine like Unity or something. After toying with it for a while, I noticed that this can become a enjoyable game just like "<strong>Dustforce</strong>", "<strong>Super Meat Boy</strong>", "<strong>I Wanna Be The Guy</strong>" which gave me great inspiration.

I always wanted to open this post a lot earlier but I was using Zero from the Megaman series as the character, so I did not want to show up with that. I work alone all the time and outsource graphics &amp; soundtracks so it took a while to get my character sprite, that's the main reason of delay.

<strong>Detailed concept art of the main character</strong></p>
<strong>Completed big features:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Level selection:</strong> It is not linear, it spreads as a web so there is a lot of choice in path. Every level is a small/mid-size level which has variety of obstacles in it.</li>
	<li><strong>Replay System:</strong> Your replay is automaticly sent to the server with your time score and it is a very small file(3-4 KB).</li>
	<li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> At the end of every level, there is a world-wide online leaderboard only about that level. You are able to watch anyone's replay easily on the leaderboard. 1st guy or 13371337th guy, everyone is stored.</li>
	<li><strong>Racing with the Ghost:</strong> You can race against every player's replay, next to you as a ghost.</li>
	<li><strong>Advanced Level Editor:</strong> An advanced level editor which is comfortable as the "Paint" like Undo, Redo, Area-fill, you can change any properties of the level objects. I spend a lot of time improving it to make sure it is good enough.</li>
	<li><strong>Custom Levels List:</strong> Any level you make in Level Editor is uploadable ingame, directly to the Custom Levels section. Every level , custom or official, has it's own leaderboard.</li>
	<li><strong>Patcher:</strong> Game updates itself automaticly whenever I push an update so you don't need to download it again and again. It is here until I go on Steam.</li>
	<li><strong>Gamepad Support:</strong> Playable with gamepad, pretty smooth, comfortable and responsive.</li>
</ul>

~~~~~~~

Only the character is done with minimal animations so, there is <strong>a lot of graphic work</strong> to do like the world itself and different themes for it, graphics for obstacles, backgrounds and the main character needs more animation frames.

Since I made the level editor and custom levels section, we(me and 2-3 friends) started making levels but we made like ~20 levels yet and most of them are not good enough to be an official level, so there is that work to do, <strong>levels</strong>.

Musician also works on soundtracks, only one is complete yet.

So thats pretty much it guys, <strong>ask </strong>me anything and also I am open for any <strong>recommendation</strong>, ideas. Just tell me what do you think  on <strong><a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=50838" target="_blank">MY DEVLOG</a></strong> and <strong>have a nice day</strong>!  :)
